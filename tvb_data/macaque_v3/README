The Virtual Macaque Brain
-------------------------- 
  A macaque connectome for large-scale network simulations in TheVirtualBrain

--------------------------
A whole-cortex macaque structural connectome constructed from a combination of axonal tract-tracing and diffusion-weighted imaging data. 
Created for modeling brain dynamics using TheVirtualBrain platform. Website: thevirtualbrain.org

The original data can be found here: https://zenodo.org/records/7011292

--------------------------
The prepare.py file builds a dictionary containing labels and their associated indexes (starting from 0). 
Originally the "surf_labels.txt" file had vertices on the surface pointing towards a non-existent region (label 0).
We handled this problem by adding two new unknown regions and assigning these vertices to these new regions.
When the region mapping is created, if we find a label value that is not pointing to an existing region, we assign
that vertex to one of the unknown regions (41 or 83) based on its x coordinate. By adding these two new regions, 
the connectivity weights and tract-lengths have to be updated with two rows of zeros and two columns of zeros at 
corresponding indexes and the "alter_tracts_and_weights" function does just that. 

--------------------------
The following entities can be imported from this folder in this order:
- a Connectivity with adjacency weights and tract-length matrices for 84 regions 
- a Cortical Surface with 147460 vertices and corresponding triangles (NOT zero based triangles)
- a vector for Region Mapping (assigning to each vertex a region index)
- a VolumeMapping having 84 regions in the 3D volume
